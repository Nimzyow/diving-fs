1. create a simple apollo server. basic hello world DONE
2. create a prisma schema with user type only with only a few fields
3. generate gql schema with nexus and add context

NOTES:

It seems that nexus automatically generates the GQL schema and nexus types when you spin up the server. currently with `npx nodemon`
